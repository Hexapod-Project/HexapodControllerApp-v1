# Hexapod Controller App

An app to control the <a href="https://github.com/edw-lee/HexapodRobot">Hexapod Robot</a>.

It uses bluetooth to send joystick data to the Esp32 microcontroller which is then used to control the positions of the hexapod.

Check the MakeFile for some useful macros for the project.

Ps. The title "Hexxo" in the app is the name of the hexapod. :D
